# EX-4 IMPLEMENTATION OF ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL (ARP)
# DATE : 30.03.2023
# AIM :
### To write a python program for simulating ARP protocols using TCP

# ALGORITHM :
# CLIENT:
### 1.Start the program
### 2.Using socket connection is established between client and server.
### 3.Get the IP address to be converted into MAC address.
### 4.Send this IP address to server.
### 5.Server returns the MAC address to client.
# SERVER:
### 1.Start the program
### 2.Accept the socket which is created by the client.
### 3.Server maintains the table in which IP and corresponding MAC addresses are stored.
### 4.Read the IP address which is send by the client.
### 5.Map the IP address with its MAC address and return the MAC address to client.

# CLIENT PROGRAM :
```PY
## Developed : R Amrish
## Reg no : 212221040012
import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',8000))
s.listen(5)
c,addr=s.accept()
address={"165.165.80.80":"6A:08:AA:C2","165.165.79.1":"8A:BC:E3:FA"};
while True:
    ip=c.recv(1024).decode()
    try:
        c.send(address[ip].encode())
    except KeyError:
        c.send("Not Found".encode())

```
# SERVER PROGRAM :
```PY
import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.connect(('localhost',8000))
while True:
    ip=input("Enter logical Address : ")
    s.send(ip.encode())
    print("MAC Address",s.recv(1024).decode())

```
# SERVER OUTPUT :
![output](./output.png)

# RESULT:
### Thus, the python program for simulating ARP protocols using TCP was successfully executed.
